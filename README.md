## üß± Part 2 - Modular Architecture & Execution Design

TotalRecon is designed as a **modular, multi-language toolkit** where each module performs a focused data extraction task ‚Äî either locally or in parallel. The system is fully scriptable, allowing individual modules to be executed standalone or orchestrated via a unified controller interface.

---

### üß© Core Architectural Principles

- **Language Interoperability**: Components in C, C++, Rust, C#, Python, and PowerShell work independently, with data passed via temporary files, IPC, or subprocess calls.
- **Extensibility First**: New modules can be added without modifying the core engine ‚Äî just follow the naming and output schema.
- **Clean Data Pipeline**: Each module outputs **structured data** (JSON, CSV, or XML), which is then parsed, logged, or visualized.
- **Cross-Platform-Ready Design** (initial focus on Windows, but prepared for expansion to Linux/macOS).
- **No Admin? No Problem**: The system gracefully falls back to limited-mode operations when administrative privileges are unavailable.
